 CASIMIRGeneralNthTrace
     Format:-CasimirG INTEGER REP1, REP2
      Modes:-REP
 Description:- Calculates the trace of the INTEGER-th order Casimir invariant
             for rep1 with respect to rep2. The command is available
             for all the compact semisimple Lie groups.
    Example:-REP>
           ->gr e8
             Group is E(8)
             REP>
           ->casimirg 2 21^7,21 
             60**1*trace 2th order Casimir invariant is 96
             REP>
           ->casimirg 3 21,21
             60**2*trace 3th order Casimir invariant is -36000
             REP>

NOTES: The output actually gives the Casimir invariant for REP2 with
respect to REP1 since setting REP1=adjoint gives the same
results as CASIMIRN.
