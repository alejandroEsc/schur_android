 CLASS
     Format:-CLASS EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-EXPR should be a list of partitions without multiplicity, and
 	      the output of CLASS EXPR is the same list but now with 
	      multiplicities equal to the number of elements in the
	      corresponding class of the symmetric group of the appropriate 
	      weight. For partitions of weight N>13 overflow can be expected.
              To obtain results for N > 13 you may determine the number of 
	      elements in a single class using the command HCLass as shown
	      below.
    Example:-SFN>
           ->class 5 + 41 + 32 + 31^2 + 2^21 + 21^3 + 1^5
	24{5} + 30{41} + 20{32} + 20{31^2} + 15{2^2 1} + 10{21^3} + {1^5}
	SFN>
	    ->class 32+42
	90{42} + 20{32}
	SFN>
           ->hclass!15 5 
	Number of elements in the class = 
	32438693442355200
	SFN>
