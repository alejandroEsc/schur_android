 COMPLement

     Format:- COMPLement INTEGER1, INTEGER2, EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:- INTEGER1 should be greater than or equal to greatest number
               of parts of any partition in EXPR, while INTEGER2 should be 
	       greater than or equal to the largest part of any partition in EXPR. 
 	       (Otherwise an error message appears). Each partition in EXPR is
	       then replaced by its complement with respect to 
	       INTEGER1^INTEGER2. Thus, given that the above conditions on
	       these integers are satisfied, then COMPL M,N,EXPR is equivalent
	       to SKew M^N,EXPR, complete with multiplicities.
    Example:-SFN>
           ->compl 6, 4, 321 -2.2+31^5
	- 2{4^5 2} + {4^3 321} + {3^5 1}
