 CONV_D_TO_Sfn
     Format:-Conv_D_to_S EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Converts a list of DPreps into a list of S-functions.
             N.B. It is assumed that the DPreps involve just one
             group else an error message is given. Assumes the irreps
             are of type tensor and do not have attached labels or
             mixed notation. Useful for doing plethysms in the DPMode.
             The inverse of converting a list of S-functions into a
             list of DPreps is accomplished by [conv_s_to_r EXPR] where
             EXPR can be a list of S-functions or an S-function
             expression that generates a list of S-functions. e.g.
             [conv_s_to_r 21+321] or [conv_s_to_r o21,21] etc.
