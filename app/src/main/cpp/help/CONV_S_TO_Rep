 CONV_S_TO_Rep
     Format:-Conv_S_to_R OPERATION(s) EXPR
      Modes:-REP, DPM
 Description:-Converts an S-function EXPR to REP form.  default = direct 
 	     transfer a -> {a}
             SPin EXPR adds a spin label to EXPR, a -> [s;a]
             MIXedTensorReps EXPR1,EXPR2 forms a mixed tensor a,b -> {a;b}
             LABel CHAR adds a one character label CHAR to EXPR as in SO(2k) 
	     (e.g. a -> [a]+)
             More than one operation may be used at a time. The hierachy is 
	     SPin, LABel, MIXedTensorReps.
             The resulting irreps may not be in standard form in which case
	     the command STD should be used. The command may be used for an
	     appropriately set group in either REP or DPMode. In the case of
	     the latter this command may be applied to one or more groups.
    Example:-REP>
           ->gr so6
	Group is SO(6)
	REP>
           ->conv_s_to_r spin label - outer2,1
	[s;3]- + [s;21]-
	REP>
           ->gr u5
	Group is U(5)
	REP>
           ->Conv_s_to_r mixed 21,31
	{21;31}
	REP>
	   -> dpm
	DPrep Mode (with function)
  	Group is U(5)
	DP>
	   -> gr3 u5sp4so6
	Groups are   U(5) * Sp(4) * SO(6)
	DP>
	   -> [conv_s_to_r mixed 21,31*43*conv_s_to_r spin label - o2,1]
	{21;31}<43>[s;3]- + {21;31}<43>[s;21]-
	DP>
