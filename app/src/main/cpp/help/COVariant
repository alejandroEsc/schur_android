 COVariant
     Format:-COV EXPR
      Modes:-REP
 Description:-Converts a mixed tensor irrep of the group U(n) into an
             equivalent covariant irrep. The group must be set as U(n)
             else an error message is generated. The result is 
             printed as {p;lambda} where the integer 'p' is to be
             interpreted as the exponent of the one-dimensional irrep
             whose basis is a totally antisymmetric n-th rank covariant
             tensor and 'lambda' is a standard covariant irrep of U(n).
   Example:- REP>
          -> gr u6
             Group is U(6)
             REP>
         ->  cov 21;321
             {-2;54321}
             REP>
