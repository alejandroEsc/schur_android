 DEAD

     Format:- DEAD  qfn1,qfn2,qfn3
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:- qfn1,qfn2, qfn3 are Q-functions specified by partitions.
              DEAD is a Boolean operator that is FALSE if the Q-function
              qfn1 does not appear in the Q-function product qfn2 . qfn3.
              If DEAD is TRUE then qfn1 probably appears in the product,
              This is an implementaion of Theorem 2 in J. Math. Phys, (31)
              1310 (1990). 
   Example:-
             SFN>
           ->dead!10 654321,32,765431
             dead =true
             SFN>            
           ->dead 9875421,32,765431
             dead =false
             SFN>
