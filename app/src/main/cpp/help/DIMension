 DIMensions
     Format:-Dim EXPR
      Modes:-DPM, REP
 Description:-Calculates the dimensions of EXPR. Dimensions are computed
             for all the compact semisimple Lie groups and the symmetric
             groups and for the representations associated with products
             of those groups. Dimensions for the supergroups U(m/n) and
             OSp(m/n) can be calculated by first branching to their maximal
             subgroups U(m) * U(n) or O(m) * Sp(n).
   Examples:-DP>
           ->gr3su8sp4so6
             Groups are SU(8) * Sp(4) * SO(6)
             DP>
           ->dim[4321*42*s321+]
             Dimension = 6035420160
