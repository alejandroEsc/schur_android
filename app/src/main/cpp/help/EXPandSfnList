 EXPandSfnList
     Format:- Exp EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Expands EXPR by expressing every term c{a} as a sum of c terms 
	      {a} if c is positive, and as a sum of -c terms -{a} if c is 
	      negative, so that in the final expression all coefficients are either +1 or -1.
    Example:-SFN>
           ->exp 3.321 -2.21
	{321} + {321} + {321} - {21} - {21}
	     SFN>
