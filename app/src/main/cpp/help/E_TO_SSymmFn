 E_TO_SsymmFn
     Format:- E_To_S EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of elementary symmetric functions
             e_{\lambda} and transforms them into a list of Schur
             symmetric functions.
    Example:-
             SFN>
           ->e_to_s 21
             {21} + {1^3}
	     SFN>
