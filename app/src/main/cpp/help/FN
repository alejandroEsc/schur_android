 FN
     Format:- Fn INTEGER
      Modes:-DPM, REP, SFN
 Description:-INTEGER is N. Fn executes function N, N =1,...,50. 
	  Usually only the result of the last command in function N
          is ported to the screen. The exceptions are the results of
	  the PROP, DIM, GRoup and mode change commands. If you wish
    	  other intermediate results to appear on the screen use the
	  command SUPpressOutputToScreen at the appropriate place in
	  your function. N.B. Functions cannot call other functions,
	  i.e. you may not have Fn N as a line in a function. 
	  An extensive account of the construction and use of 
	  functions is given in the Tutorial 7.2.
