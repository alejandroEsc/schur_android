 FUSion
     Format:- Fus INTEGER EXPR
      Modes:-REP
 Description:-The INTEGER, which should be positive, is the level of an
 	     affine representation, and EXPR a list of irreps of either 
	     SU(n) or Sp(n). In the case of SU(n) the group should be set 
	     as U(n) and the irreps given in mixed form. It is assumed 
	     that the irreps are either standard or have been made standard 
	     with the operation STD. For further details see Cummins, 
	     J.Phys.A:Math.Gen. 24,391-400(1991).
   Examples:-REP>
           ->gr sp10
	Group is Sp(10)
	REP>
           ->std532^6
	- <532^3>
	REP>
           ->fus 3 last
	<3^2 2^3>
	REP>
           ->gr u8
	Group is U(8)
	REP>
           ->std 7632^31;982^41
	{7631;9821}
	REP>
           ->fus 10 last
	{43^2 1;6521}
