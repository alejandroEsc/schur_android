 GRoup
     Format:- Gr INTEGER GROUPNAMES (DPM)
              Gr GROUPNAME     (REP)
      Modes:-DPM, REP
 Description:-Sets the group(s) with respect to which all rep and DPrep 
 	     calculations are done. INTEGER is the number of groups in a 
	     direct product and is not required if equals to 1. The 
	     maximum number of groups that may be set in DPM is 6. 
	     Table A.3 shows how the available groups are to be entered.
             N.B. Not all the groups listed in Table A.3 are available for
	     all the commands in SCHUR so check the appropriate commands.
    Example:-DP>
           ->gr4e8f4g2e6
             Groups are E(8) * F(4) * G(2) * E(6)
             DP>
           ->gr sumn4 6
             Group is SU(4/6)
             DP>
