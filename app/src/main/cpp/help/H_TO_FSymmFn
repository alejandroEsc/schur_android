 H_TO_FsymmFn
     Format:-H_To_F EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of homogeneous symmetric functions
             h_{\lambda} and transforms them into a list of forgotten
             symmetric functions f_{\mu}.
    Example:-
             SFN>
           ->h_to_f 21
             f_{21}  + 3f_{1^3}
             SFN>
