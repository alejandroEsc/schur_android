 H_TO_SsymmFn
     Format:-H_To_S EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of homogeneous symmetric functions
             h_{\lambda} and transforms them into a list of Schur
             symmetric functions.
    Example:-
             SFN>
           ->h_to_s 21
             {3} + {21}
             SFN>
