     Format:-INDEX INTEGERS
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-INDEX acts on a sequence of positive integers to produce
             a new sequence known as the Index of the Sequence. If the
             members of the sequence are a(r) r = 1,2 ...,N then the
             index i(r) is defined as the number of integers in the
             sequence lying to the left of a(r) which are equal to a(r),
             including a(r) itself, minus the number of integers lying
             to the left of a(r) which are equal to a(r) - 1.
