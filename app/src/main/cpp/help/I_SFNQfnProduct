     Format:- I_SfnQ EXPR1,EXPR2
      Modes:- SFN
 Description:-Calculates the sum of the inner products of pairs consisting of
             an S-function in EXPR1 and a Q-function in EXPR 2 that have the 
	     same weight, including the product of their coefficients. It
	     gives zero if there no such pairs having the same weight. 
    Example:-SFN>
           ->i_sfnq 321, 6 -5 +2.51
	4Q_{6} + 11Q_{51} + 18Q_{42} + 3Q_{321}
