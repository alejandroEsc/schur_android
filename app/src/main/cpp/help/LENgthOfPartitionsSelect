 LENgthOfPartitionsSelect
     Format:- Len grno,INTEGER, EXPR  (DPM)
              Len INTEGER, EXPR       (REP, SFN)
      Modes:-DPM, REP, SFN
 Description:-In the DPMode if INTEGER is positive all terms in  EXPR which
             are of length INTEGER or less for grno are returned. 
             If INTEGER is negative then all terms in EXPR having a 
             number of parts equal to the magnitude of INTEGER for grno
             are returned.
             In the REP or SFN mode If INTEGER is positive then all terms 
             in  EXPR which are of length INTEGER or less are returned. 
             If INTEGER  is negative then all terms in EXPR having a 
             number of parts equal to the magnitude of INTEGER are returned.
    Example:- SFN>
           ->len 3,321+321^2 + 31 +2^6+2
             {321} + {31} + {2}
             SFN>
           ->len -3,last
             {321}
             SFN>
