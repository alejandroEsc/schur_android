 Description:-A logfile maybe setup at anytime by use of the command
             Log'filename'. This has the effect of directing current
             results to the file `filename'. This file may be closed
             at anytime by issuing the command  Log''. The filename
             'prn.' should direct the output to an attached printer.
             Exiting SCHUR will automatically close the current logfile.
             A logfile may be subsequently edited by any appropriate
             text editor.

           ->log'testfile.tst'
