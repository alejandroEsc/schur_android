 MAKEwtOfSfnToN
     Format:- Make INTEGER EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Takes each partition in EXPR and makes each one up to weight
             INTEGER by inserting an appropriate first part and then returns a 
	     standardised list. Useful in going from reduced notation for S(N)
             to a specific value of INTEGER.
    Example:-SFN>
           ->make 10 421+32+31+2^3
	{631} + {532} + {42^3}
	SFN>
	   ->make 8 421+32+31+2^3
	{431} + {3^2 2} - {32^2 1} + {2^4}
	SFN>
