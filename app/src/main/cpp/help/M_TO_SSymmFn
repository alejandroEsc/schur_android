 M_To_SsymmFn
     Format:- M_To_S EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of monomial symmetric functions
             m_{\lambda} and transforms them into a list of
             Schur symmetric functions.
    Example:-
             SFN>
           ->m_to_s 21
             {21} - 2{1^3}
             SFN>
