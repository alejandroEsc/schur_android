 PLG
     Format:- PLG REP
      Modes:- REP
 Description:-The group must be set to be G2. Then PLG acts on a single REP of
             G2 to produce an EXPR consisting of a list of irreps of G2,
	     together with appropriate coefficients, such that the plethysm
	     (10) \otimes EXPR returns just REP.
    Example:-REP>
           -> gr g2
	Group is G(2)
	REP>            
           -> plg 21
	(1^2) - (1)
	REP>            
           -> pl 1,last
	(21)
	REP>
