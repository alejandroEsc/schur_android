 PLethysm
     Format:- Pl EXPR1, EXPR2
      Modes:-REP, SFN
 Description:-Calculates the plethysm of EXPR1 \otimes EXPR2.
             In the SFN MODE EXPR1 and EXPR2 may be lists of
             S-functions while in the REP MODE EXPR1 may be
             tensor reps of U(n), SU(n), SO(2k+1), O(n) or G(2).
             Plethysms may also be evaluated for single irreps of Sp(2n,R) or
             SO^*(2n).
             In that case first setlimit to say 12 and set_pwt to say 12
             and terms to weight 12 will be computed. Higher values of
             setlimit and set_pwt will yield higher weight terms but will
             take longer to compute. 
    Examples:-REP>
           ->gr g2
	Group is G(2)
	REP>
           ->pl 21,2
	(42) + (2) + (0)
	REP>
	   ->sfn
	Schur Function Mode
	SFN>
           ->pl 21,2
	{42} + {321} + {31^3} + {2^3}
	SFN>
