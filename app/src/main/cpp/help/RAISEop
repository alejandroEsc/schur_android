 RAISEop
     Format:- Raise s, EXPR (s = +/- 1)
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-  Raise is the operator \prod_{i<j} (1 + sR_{ij}) with
              the phase s taking values +1 or -1, while R_{ij} acts
	      on each term {\lambda} in EXPR by increasing the ith
	      component of lambda by 1 and decreasing the jth component by 1.
	      In the case s=1 the final expression is subject to Q-function
              standardisation. In the case s=-1 the final expression is
	      subject to H-function standardisation, by which is meant any
	      term {\mu} involving a negative component is set to zero, while
	      in each of the remaining terms the components are permuted so to
	      give a partition.  
   Examples:-
	SFN>
           ->raise 1,321
	{51} + 2{42} + {321}
	SFN>
           ->raise 1,2^2
	{31}
	SFN>
           ->raise -1,321
	{51} - {41^2} - {3^2} + {321}
	SFN>
