     Format:-RIB_TO_S EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of parts of a ribbon Schur function,
             which is then evaluated as a skew Schur function and expressed
             as a list of Schur function.
    Example:-SFN>
           ->rib_to_s 312
	{41^2} + {321}
	SFN>
           ->rib_to_s 123
	{42} + {41^2} + {321}
	SFN>
