 RIEMANNPlethList
     Format:-RiemannP N
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-A list of S-functions is formed as for  RiemannL N
             and then the operation  RiemannP is performed on that list.
             The operation RiemannP is related to a problem posed by
             S. A. Fulling in relationship to the determination of the
             independent scalars that can be formed by contraction
             of the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives.
    Example:- SFN>
           ->riemannp 6
	{6^2} + {642} + 2{64} + {62^3} + 2{62^2} + {62} + {4^3} 
	+ 2{4^2 2^2} + 2{4^2 2} + {42^4} + 2{42^3} + {2^6}
