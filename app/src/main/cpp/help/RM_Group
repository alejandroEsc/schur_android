 RM_Group
     Format:-Rm_G grN EXPR
      Modes:-DPM
 Description:-Eliminates the N-th group from DPrep EXPR.
             This can be useful in branching chains where
             groups may become redundant.
    Example:-
             DP>
           ->gr2u1su5
             Groups are U(1) * SU(5)
             DP>
           ->[1*31] + [2*2]
             {2}{2} + {1}{31}
             DP>
           ->rm_g 1,last
             Group is SU(5)
             {31} + {2}
             DP>
