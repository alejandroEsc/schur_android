 Description:-RULE makes use of the DPrep structure by allowing
             S-function operations on the partitions labelling the
             representations of the component groups. This is the most
             complex, and also most powerful, command in SCHUR  and is
             fully discussed in the Advanced Tutorial:Using Rule. Use
             of this command should not be attempted until the user
             has become familiar with most of the commands and structures
             in SCHUR.
