 SB_DIMension
	Format:- Sb_Dim [TRUE|FALSE]
	Modes:- SFN,REP,DPM
    Description:- Sb_Dim is a Boolean whose default value has been set as
          TRUE which permits the command  DIMension to calculate the
          dimensions of representations using the Weyl formulae. Setting
          Sb_Dim FALSE permits the command DIMension to calculate the
          corresponding dimensions using the hooklength formulae.
