 SB_REVerseOrder
      Format:- SB_REV [TRUE|FALSE]
       Modes:- DPM, REP, SFN
 Description:- Schur outputs lists of expressions that are normally
        sorted antilexicographically with respect to the alphabet 
	1,2,3,.... In the DPMode this will be for the
        first group in the list of product groups. Setting
        SB_REVerseOrder TRUE reverses this order. FALSE is the
        default setting.
    Example:-SFN>
       ->   o21,3
            {51} + {42} + {41^2} + {321}
            SFN>
       ->   sb_rev true
            SFN>
       ->   last
            {321} + {41^2} + {42} + {51}
            SFN>
