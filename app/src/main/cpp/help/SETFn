 SETFn
     Format:- Setf N
      Modes:-DPM,REP,SFN
 Description:-Used to set function N, N = 1... 50, during a
             SCHUR session. It prompts you to enter each line with
             a "=-". STop signals completion. If you make a mistake
             there is no way of editing the function. Either retype the
             function or save it on disk with WRFNTODisk and use
             a text editor to correct it. If editing a function saved on
             disk remember to make the last line STop (with a carriage
             return). For an extensive discussion see the tutorial on
             writing functions. 
    Example:-DP>
           ->setfn1
	=-
           ->rem evaluates the sfn outer product sv1.sv2
	=-
           ->sfn
	=-
           ->enter sv1
	=-
           ->enter sv2
	=-
           ->o sv1,sv2
	=-
           ->stop
	DP>
           ->fn1
	Schur Function Mode
	enter sv1
	->21
	enter sv2
	->2^2
	{43} + {421} + {3^2 1} + {32^2} + {321^2} + {2^3 1}

NOTES:No verification is made on what is typed inside a function 
so be careful. Moreover if you call another function inside a
function, no return is made to the caller function.
