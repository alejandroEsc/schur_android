 SIGNSEQuence
     Format:-signseq n, rep                (REPmode)
             signseq k,n,char,boolean,sfn  (SFNmode)
      Modes:-REP,SFN
 Description:-*REP* Used to construct a signed sequence of a Rep that involves
             up to n parts for the groups O(k), SO(k) or Sp(2k). Signed
             sequences may be constructed for any rep except for the
             tensor reps of SO(2k) having k non-zero parts.

             In the special case of the group U(k) the signed sequence is
             constructed as in page 3127 of 
             J.Phys.A:Math. Gen.(18), 3113 (1985). The format for entry
             in this case is
              signseq Q,P, rep
             where rep is a mixed tensor irrep of U(k) and Q and P limit
             the parts of the contravariant and covariant tensors respectively. 

             *SFN* Used to construct a signed sequence of an S-function
             that involves up to n parts which when treated as group
             representations in the REP mode of O(k) or Sp(2k) all
             modify to a single irrep of the group. Of particular
             use in developing algorithms for the non-compact groups.
             The character char designates the A, C or G series of
             S-functions. Choosing the boolean TRUE results in a
             signed sequence of S-functions whose maximal number of
             parts is min(k,n) while setting the boolean FALSE restricts
             the number of parts to n. It is assumed that sfn is a single
             S-function. The S-function may be followed by the character
             '#' if associated characters of O(k) are being considered.
             In the case of Sp(2k) char ='A', while for O(k) if k is even
             char = 'C' while for odd k char = 'G'.
    Example:- REP>
              ->gr o5
	Group is O(5)
	REP>
              ->wt 16 signseq10,21
	- [432^2 1^4] + [3^2 2^2 1^3] - [2^4 1] + [21]
	REP>
	      ->wt 16 signseq10,21#
	[5321^6] - [4321^5] + [3^2 21^4] - [2^3 1^2] + [21^2]
	REP>
