 SPLitIntoSpinAndTensor
     Format:-Spl EXPR
      Modes:-REP
 Description:-Spl acts on a REP List and writes the tensor reps to
             RVar 1 and the spinor reps to RVar 2. This command
             is very useful in problems involving supersymmetry.
             Spl Lists may be recombined by use of  ADD RV1,RV2.
    Example:-
             REP>
           ->gr so6
             Group is SO(6)
             REP>
           ->split 321+ + s21- + 2 + s1+
             REP>
           ->rv1
             [321]+ + [2]
             REP>
           ->rv2
             [s;21]- + [s;1]+
             REP>
