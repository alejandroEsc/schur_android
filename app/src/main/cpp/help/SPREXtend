 SPREXtend
     Format:-SPREX  EXPR1
      Modes:-REP
 Description:-Takes a set of Sp(2n,R) irreps and extends the partitions
             labelling the irreps to yield new standard irreps of Sp(2n,R)
             such that if the appropriate O(k) modification rules were
             applied the original irreps would be restored to within an
             associate label '#' which is suppressed. See also ASSOCiate
             and SPONModify. NB. The group must be set as Sp(2n,R) - other
             group settings will produce an error message.

    Example:-REP>
           -> gr spr8
              Group is Sp(8,R)
             REP>
           -> 2;0 + 2;2 + 2;2^2
              <2(0)> + <2(2)> + <2(2^2)>
             REP>
           -> sprex last
              <2(2^2)> + <2(21^2)> + <2(1^4)> 
             REP>
