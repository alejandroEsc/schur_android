	       .........10........20........30........40........50

	   var:123____8_._________.1________._________._________.


      where T or F indicates the status of the flag, i.e. TRUE or FALSE.
      If LOGGING is TRUE then the chosen name of the current logfile
      is displayed. The third line indicates the numbers of the
      functions that have been set. In the above example FNS 1,2,6 and
      10 have been set. The forth line displays the VARS that have
      been set in the DPMode. In the REPmode the number of RVARS are 
      displayed or in the SFNmode the number of SVARS are displayed. 
      In each case the number of VARS, RVARS, or SVARS is given modulo
      10 and hence in the above the VARS 1,2,3,8, and 21 have been set.
