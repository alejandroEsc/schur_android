 STD
     Format:-Std EXPR
      Modes:-DPM, REP, SFN
 Description:-Converts a list of DPreps, Reps or Sfns into a list of
             standardised DPreps, Reps or Sfns. The command is available
             for all compact semisimple Lie groups, for the tensor reps
             of U(m/n), SU(m/n) and OSp(m/n) and the spin and ordinary
             reps of S(n). See also  STD_OneDprep and  STD_Qfn.
    Example:-
	DP>
           ->gr2so5sp4
	Groups are SO(5) * Sp(4)
	DP>
           ->std[31^3 * 31^3]
	- [3]<31>
	DP>
