 S_TO_HsymmFn
     Format:-S_To_H EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of S-functions and transforms them into a
             list of homogeneous symmetric functions h_{\mu}.
    Example:-
             SFN>
           ->s_to_h 21
             - h_{3}  + h_{21}
             SFN>
