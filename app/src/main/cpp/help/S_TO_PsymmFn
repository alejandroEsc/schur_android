 S_TO_PsymmFn
     Format:- S_To_P EXPR
      Modes:-SFN
 Description:-Treats EXPR as a list of S-functions and transforms them into
             a list of powersum symmetric functions p_{\mu}. The normalisation
             has been chosen to give integer coefficients. The actual     
             coefficients may be obtained by dividing by n! where n is the
             weight of the partitions in EXPR. It is assumed that all the
             partitions in EXPR are of the same weight. Transformations 
             from other symmetric functions to power sum symmetric functions
             may be found by combining sequences of commands. Thus if EXPR
             is a set of elementary symmetric functions then the command
             sequence E_TO_S, S_TO_P, EXPR will yield the desired result.
