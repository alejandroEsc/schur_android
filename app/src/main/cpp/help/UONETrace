 UONETrace
     Format:-UONET EXPR
      Modes:-DPM
 Description:-UONETrace evaluates the trace when one of the set
             Groups is U(1). This is useful in checking branching rules
             leading to the appearance of a U(1) group.  UONETrace
             multiplies the dimension of each rep in EXPR by its
             corresponding U(1) weight and should yield a null result.
    Example:-DP>
           ->gr so8
	Group is SO(8)
	DP>
           ->branch26,8gr1[s1+]
	Groups are   U(1) * SU(4)
	{6}{1} + {2}{21} + {2}{1^3} + {-2}{2^2 1} + {-2}{1} + {-6}{1^3}
	DP>
           ->uonet last
	Utrace = 0
	DP>
