<p align=justify>Professor Brian Wybourne died in Torun,
Poland, on 26 November 2003.
He is greatly missed by family, friends and colleagues.</p>

<p align=justify>
Following Brian Wybourne's death we (Franck Butelle, Ronald
King and
Fr√©ric Toumazet) felt that his programme SCHUR should be
maintained,
and if possible enhanced, with a view to making it freely
available to
the mathematical and physics research community.</p>

<p align=justify>
To this end we have produced a new version of SCHUR, currently
SCHUR 6.02. While we have carried out a number of tests of the
new
version on different platforms with different operating
systems, it
comes with no guarantee. It may be downloaded from:</p>

<A
HREF=http://sourceforge.net/projects/schur>http://sourceforge.net/projects/schur</A>

<p align=justify>
We are extremely grateful to Brian Wybourne's family for
allowing
us to make this programme freely available. It was constructed
over many years by Brian and a succession of his students and
colleagues, with the version SCHUR 5.0 first marketed through
the
good offices of Steven Christensen.</p>

<p align=justify>
We hope that SCHUR will be of use in various research
activities,
and would appreciate feedback about its effectiveness
and any bugs that you may find. It is anticipated that updates
will be made available from time to time.</p>

<h2><img src="images/sundot.jpg"> What is Schur?  </h2>

Schur is a stand alone C program for interactively calculating
properties of Lie groups and symmetric functions. Schur has
been designed
to answer questions of relevance to a wide range of problems of
special
interest to chemists, mathematicians and physicists -
particularly for
persons who need specific knowledge relating to some aspect of
Lie groups
or symmetric functions and yet do not wish to be encumbered
with complex
algorithms. The objective of Schur is to supply results with
the complexity
of the algorithms hidden from view so that the user can
effectively use
Schur as a scratch pad, obtaining a result and then using that
result to
derive new results in a fully interactive manner. Schur can be
used as a
tool for calculating branching rules, <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Kronecker.html">
Kronecker</a> products, Casimir invariants,
dimensions, plethysms, S-function operations, Young diagrams
and their hook
lengths etc. 
<p> 
As well as being a research tool Schur forms an excellent tool
for helping
students to independently explore the properties of <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Lie.html">
Lie </a> groups and symmetric
functions and to test their understanding by creating simple
examples and
moving on to more complex examples. The user has at his or her
disposal over
160 commands which may be nested to give a vast variety of
potential
operations. Every command, with examples, is described in a 200
page manual.
Attention has been given to input/output issues to simplify
input and to
give a well organized output. The output may be obtained in TeX
form if
desired. Log files may be created for subsequent editing. On
line help files
may be brought to screen at any time.
</p><p>    
<b>Place Schur in your workstation, PC or portable notebook and
you have available
a host of information on Lie groups and symmetric functions. A
tool both for
teaching and research.</b>
 
</p><p>
</p><h2><img src="images/sundot.jgp"> What can Schur do?
</h2>

Among the many tasks amenable to Schur are the following:
<ul>
<li>The calculation of Kronecker products for all the compact
Lie
groups
and for the ordinary and spin representations of the symmetric
group. Not
only for individual irreducible representations but also lists
of irreducible representations.  List handling
is a general feature of Schur.
</li><li> The calculation of branching rules with the ability
to
successively branch through a chain of nested groups.
</li><li> The calculation of the properties of irreducible
representations such as dimensions,
second-order Casimir and Dynkin invariants, the trace of the
n-th order
Casimir invariants and the conversion between partition and
Dynkin
labelling of irreducible representations.
</li><li> The handling of direct products of several groups.
</li><li> The computation of a wide range of properties related
to <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Schur.html">
Schur</a>
function operations such as the Littlewood-Richardson rule,
inner products,
skew products, and plethysms as well as the inclusion of
commands for
generating the terms in infinite series of Schur functions up
to a user
defined cutoff.
</li><li> The computation of the properties of the symmetric
Q-functions
with respect to operations such as the analogous
Littlewood-Richardson
rule, skew and inner products.
</li><li> The standardisation of non-standard representations
of groups
by the use of modification procedures.
</li><li> Calculation of properties of the classical symmetric
functions.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h2><img src="images/sundot.jgp"> Among the special
features of Schur</h2>
<ul>
<li>All operations can be made on lists of irreducible
representations  and not just single
irreducible representations.
</li><li> Sequences of instructions may be set as functions
(which may be
saved on disk)  allowing easy extension of Schur   to implement
user
defined rules.
</li><li> Results of a session with Schur   may be saved as a
logfile
for future record or editing.
</li><li> Over 160 commands allow a wide variety of
applications of
Schur.
</li><li> Schur   can be a valuable tool in the teaching of the
properties
of groups as students and teachers can readily create examples.
Taken with
this manual it can be used as a self-paced learning tool.
</li><li> Schur   can be used as a research tool in many
studies.
</li></ul>
